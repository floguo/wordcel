# Wordcel - A GUI Dictionary Application

## Project Description
**Wordcel** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to provide word definitions, pronunciations, and examples in an accessible and user-friendly manner. The app integrates with the [DictionaryAPI](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to fetch real-time word data and uses the `pygame` library for audio playback of pronunciations.

This project demonstrates practical applications of Python's `tkinter` library for GUI design, alongside HTTP API integration and audio playback capabilities. The application includes features that enhance accessibility, making it inclusive for a diverse range of users.
